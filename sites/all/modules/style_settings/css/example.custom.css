/**
 * CUSTOM CSS
 *
 * Put your custom CSS and CSS overrides in this file and rename it
 * custom.css. Your changes will not be overwritten when upgrading to a new
 * version of this module. You can also use a custom-rtl.css file for the
 * equivalent in RTL.
 *
 * Steps to activate custom.css:
 * 1. Add your custom CSS to this file
 * 2. Rename this file to custom.css
 * 3. Clear cached data at admin/settings/performance
 *
 * If you put your custom CSS here it will be:
 * - rewritten if it contains Drupal variables 
 * - loaded as the last stylesheet so no other CSS will overwrite it.
